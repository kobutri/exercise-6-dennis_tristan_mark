Back substitution is sequential in nature.
We use a modified createExchangePattern that only considers the elements of the lower triangular matrix.
We cannot use our parallel exchange_vector_data, because solving for entry n of the vector requires all previous solutions.
To achieve this, every process first receives all previous results, calculates it's own and then sends those to the other processes.
