In order to parallelize Gauss Seiel precondonditioning, we need to implement parallelized backsubstitution.
The implementation used right now, uses a naive approach, where every process sends the solutions of their partition
to the other processes.
First, receive solutions from all previous processes.
Second, perform normal backsubstition on the partition owned by the process
Third, broadcast these solutions to all other processes.

A more sophisticated solution would use a modified ExchangePattern, that works on the lower triangular matrix.
The exchange of data could not use a broadcast anymore, but a algorithm like
